      This text is written as a thought piece to accompany a shortened version
      of Serge's Rey WRSA 2014 <a href="https://github.com/sjsrey/ors">
          presidential address</a>, entitled <i>Open Regional Science</i>. Both of them are to be
      published in the June edition of the <a href="http://narsc.org"> NARSC </a> newsletter.

      The manuscript, as well as this site, are stored in an open
      repository on <a href="https://github.com/darribas/ow4ors/"> this
          url</a>. Comments and feedback most welcome.

       <div class=manuscript>
<p>In his WRSA presidential address, <span class="citation">Rey (2014)</span> makes a “<em>call to arms for regional scientists to engage with open science and open source</em>”. His premise is that Regional Science, as a discipline, has kept itself very much distant from recent developments in other fields in the way the scientific process is carried out. In particular, he considers the idea of open science, which then contrasts with the notion of <em>captured</em> science. This involves a set of practices around the way academics write software (open source), manage data (open data), carry out modeling experiments (open modeling), collaborate (open collaboration) and distribute their results (open publishing). I could not agree more with both Rey’s principles as well as his view of the current state of affairs in Regional Science. In this piece<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>, I want to add to his plea to “go open” with an aspect of open science that, although not explicitly mentioned in the address, underlies most of its philosophy: open workflows.</p>
<p>The concept of a workflow is something us regional scientists can all relate to, even though we might not realize straight away. After all, we all have a particular set of habits, techniques and tools we use to carry out the diverse activities that involve being a modern scholar. However, not much thought usually goes into the design and adoption of a <em>good</em> workflow, let alone of an <em>open</em> one. Rather, it is something seldom taught in school that the student (i.e. future researcher/scientist) is expected to “just know”, as if its acquisition and learning curve were non-existent or just surpased by simply being enrolled in a PhD program.</p>
<p>The core idea of an open workflow is XXX. What is an open workflow and what are its strengths.</p>
<p>Why is an open workflow important (transparency, reproducibility, reusability, shareability, portability… self-sanity).</p>
<p>Close up relating back to Serge’s text and encouraging readers to go open.</p>
