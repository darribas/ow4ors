# Open Workflows for Open Regional Science

Thought piece to accompany Serge Rey's WRSA presidential address at the NARSC
newsletter. Serge's piece can be found on [this
repository](https://github.com/sjsrey/ors). I have benefited much from his
approach to developing the content and making it open from early stages of its
conception.
